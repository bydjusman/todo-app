        What is a ToDo List? The definition is a simple one. <h1>
        It’s a list of
        tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do.</h1> Most
        typically, they’re organised in order of priority. Traditionally,
        they’re written on a piece of paper or post it notes and act as a memory
        aid. As technology has evolved we have been able to create a todo lists
        with excel spreadsheets, word documents, email lists, todo list apps,
        Microsoft to do and google to do list to name a few. You can use a to do
        list in your home and personal life, or in the workplace. Having a list
        of everything you need to do written down in one place means you
        shouldn’t forget anything important. By prioritising the tasks in the
        list you plan the order in which you’re going to do them and can quickly
        see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you can leave
        until a little later.
